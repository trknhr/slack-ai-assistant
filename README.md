# slack-ai-assistant

AWS Lambda + CDK scaffold for running a Slack-based assistant on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

This repository provides the application glue around AgentCore Runtime:

- Slack Events API ingestion
- asynchronous Slack processing with SQS
- scheduled runs through EventBridge Scheduler
- session mapping and event deduplication
- attachment handling for PDFs, images, and text files
- raw Slack attachment archival to private S3 storage
- custom tool execution in AgentCore Runtime backed by DynamoDB for memories, tasks, recurring tasks, and calendar drafts

The goal is to keep reasoning, tool loops, and runtime isolation inside AgentCore while handling webhooks, queues, and app-facing integrations in AWS.

## Prerequisites

1. Create these AWS Secrets Manager secrets:
   - `/slack-ai-assistant/slack-signing-secret`
   - `/slack-ai-assistant/slack-bot-token`
   - `/slack-ai-assistant/google-calendar`
2. Ensure the target account has access to Bedrock AgentCore and the configured Bedrock model.
3. Install Docker for AgentCore container image builds.
4. Bootstrap CDK in the target AWS account and region.

Google Calendar OAuth client secret JSON:

```json
{
  "client_id": "YOUR_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID",
  "client_secret": "YOUR_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "calendar_id": "primary",
  "time_zone": "Asia/Tokyo"
}
```

Each Slack user connects their own Google Calendar through:

- `GET /oauth/google/start`
- `GET /oauth/google/callback`

Add the deployed `GoogleOAuthCallbackUrl` output as an authorized redirect URI in the Google Cloud OAuth client. Calendar tools run with the Google account connected to the Slack user who requested the action.

## Deploy

```bash
npm install
npx cdk deploy \
  -c defaultScheduleChannel=C0123456789 \
  -c bedrockModelId=moonshotai.kimi-k2.5 \
  -c publicBaseUrl=https://your-api-id.execute-api.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/prod
```

Notes:

- Lambda runtime code is TypeScript and bundled with `NodejsFunction`.
- AgentCore runtime code is built as a Node 22 container from `app/SlackAgent/Dockerfile`.
- `defaultScheduleChannel` lets the scheduled runner create a fallback task automatically if `daily-summary` is missing.
- `bedrockModelId` selects the Bedrock model used by the AgentCore runtime.
- `publicBaseUrl` is used inside Slack replies when a user needs to connect Google Calendar.
- `googleCalendarSecretName` and `googleCalendarTimeZone` can be overridden with CDK context if needed.

## AgentCore Runtime

The `SlackAgent` runtime is defined in `agentcore/agentcore.json` and implemented by `src/agentcore/runtime.ts`.

The container build context lives under `app/SlackAgent/`. That directory points back to the root TypeScript source and package metadata so the Lambda code and AgentCore runtime share the same domain logic and tool definitions.

The CDK stack creates the AgentCore runtime, grants the Lambda functions invoke permission, and grants the runtime access to the DynamoDB tables and Google Calendar secret needed by the tools.

Tool groups available inside AgentCore:

- durable memory: `search_memories`, `save_memory`
- one-off tasks: `list_tasks`, `upsert_task`, `mark_task_done`
- recurring tasks: `list_recurring_tasks`, `upsert_recurring_task`, `disable_recurring_task`
- Google Calendar drafts: `list_calendar_events`, `find_free_busy`, `create_calendar_draft`, `list_calendar_drafts`, `apply_calendar_draft`, `discard_calendar_draft`

## Google Calendar Draft Flow

The app integrates Google Calendar as custom tools inside the AgentCore runtime.

Available tools:

- `list_google_calendars`
- `list_calendar_events`
- `find_free_busy`
- `create_calendar_draft`
- `list_calendar_drafts`
- `apply_calendar_draft`
- `discard_calendar_draft`

Recommended flow:

1. Extract event candidates from Slack or imported documents.
2. Save them with `create_calendar_draft`.
3. Show the returned draft preview to the user.
4. Only after explicit approval, call `apply_calendar_draft`.

Notes:

- The app uses the Google Calendar REST API from the AgentCore runtime.
- Slack users authorize their own Google Calendar accounts through OAuth.
- All-day events use date-only values and are written with Google Calendar's exclusive end-date semantics under the hood.
- Draft application is idempotent across re-imports by storing app-specific private extended properties on events.

## Local bulk import

Bulk import uses the existing private S3 archive bucket plus `SourceDocumentsTable`.

Supported formats:

- `.pdf`
- `.jpg`
- `.jpeg`
- `.png`

Recommended local input directory:

- `private-docs/`

It is ignored by git by default.

Example:

```bash
npm run import-local-docs -- \
  --api-base-url https://YOUR_API_ID.execute-api.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/prod \
  --workspace-id T0123456789 \
  --user-id U0123456789 \
  --region ap-northeast-1 \
  --wait \
  private-docs
```

Flow:

1. The script requests a presigned upload URL from `/imports/uploads`.
2. It uploads the original file to private S3.
3. It queues processing through `/imports/documents`.
4. The import worker sends the file to AgentCore Runtime, which persists memories, one-off tasks, recurring tasks, and calendar drafts through custom tools.
5. The script can poll `/imports/workspaces/{workspaceId}/sources/{sourceId}` until completion.

Security:

- `imports/*` endpoints use `AWS_IAM` authorization.
- The local script signs requests with SigV4 using your current AWS credentials.
- Your IAM principal must have `execute-api:Invoke` permission for the import routes.

## PDF to Markdown extraction

For OCR and layout evaluation, you can queue a Markdown extraction pass for uploaded PDFs without ingesting them into memories or tasks.

API routes:

- `POST /imports/extractions/markdown`
- `GET /imports/workspaces/{workspaceId}/sources/{sourceId}`
- `GET /imports/workspaces/{workspaceId}/sources/{sourceId}/markdown`

Flow:

1. Upload the original PDF through `/imports/uploads`.
2. Queue Markdown extraction through `/imports/extractions/markdown`.
3. Poll `/imports/workspaces/{workspaceId}/sources/{sourceId}` until `extractionStatus` becomes `extracted`.
4. Download the extracted Markdown through `/imports/workspaces/{workspaceId}/sources/{sourceId}/markdown`.

Example CLI:

```bash
npm run extract-pdf-markdown -- \
  --api-base-url https://YOUR_API_ID.execute-api.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/prod \
  --workspace-id T0123456789 \
  --user-id U0123456789 \
  --region ap-northeast-1 \
  --wait \
  private-docs
```

Security:

- These routes also use `AWS_IAM` authorization.
- The CLI signs requests with SigV4 using your current AWS credentials.
- Your IAM principal must have `execute-api:Invoke` permission for the extraction routes.

## Markdown ingestion

Markdown ingestion uses the same `SourceDocumentsTable`, private S3 archive bucket, and import worker. Repeating rules such as weekly or monthly duties should be captured as recurring task definitions, not as one-off task instances.

Supported formats:

- `.md`
- `.markdown`

Recommended local input directory:

- `private-notes/`

It is ignored by git by default.

Example:

```bash
npm run ingest-markdown -- \
  --api-base-url https://YOUR_API_ID.execute-api.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/prod \
  --workspace-id T0123456789 \
  --user-id U0123456789 \
  --region ap-northeast-1 \
  --wait \
  private-notes
```

Flow:

1. The script reads local markdown files and posts them to `/imports/markdown`.
2. The API stores the original markdown in private S3 under `raw/private/notes/...`.
3. It queues processing through the existing document import worker.
4. The worker sends the note to AgentCore Runtime, which persists memories, one-off tasks, recurring tasks, and calendar drafts through custom tools.
5. The script can poll `/imports/workspaces/{workspaceId}/sources/{sourceId}` until completion.

Security:

- `/imports/markdown` also uses `AWS_IAM` authorization.
- The local script signs requests with SigV4 using your current AWS credentials.
- Your IAM principal must have `execute-api:Invoke` permission for the import routes.

## Direct chat from your terminal

For quick questions outside Slack, you can call the AgentCore-backed assistant through an IAM-protected API route:

- `POST /chat/messages`

The repository also includes a signed local CLI:

```bash
npm run ask-agent -- \
  --api-base-url https://YOUR_API_ID.execute-api.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/prod \
  --workspace-id T0123456789 \
  --user-id local-importer-teru \
  --region ap-northeast-1 \
  "今日のやることは？"
```

The response includes:

- `session_id`
- the assistant text response
- any saved memory IDs
- any task IDs touched during the answer
- any recurring task IDs touched during the answer

To continue the same conversation, pass the returned `session_id` back:

```bash
npm run ask-agent -- \
  --api-base-url https://YOUR_API_ID.execute-api.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/prod \
  --workspace-id T0123456789 \
  --user-id local-importer-teru \
  --region ap-northeast-1 \
  --session-id sess_... \
  "今夜中のものだけ教えて"
```

Notes:

- `/chat/messages` uses `AWS_IAM` authorization.
- The route is synchronous and best suited to short questions.
- For long-running workflows, keep using Slack, scheduled jobs, or import workers.

## Current scope

- EventBridge Scheduler triggers `daily-summary`
- scheduled Agent run definitions live in `ScheduledTasksTable`
- recurring task definitions live in `RecurringTasksTable`
- the scheduled runner materializes enabled recurring tasks for the next 7 days before building the daily reminder
- fallback scheduled tasks can be created from `outputChannelId` in the invoke payload or from `defaultScheduleChannel`

Example scheduled task item:

```json
{
  "pk": "TASK#daily-summary",
  "taskId": "daily-summary",
  "name": "Daily Summary",
  "prompt": "Summarize yesterday's activity and post a concise update.",
  "workspaceId": "T0123456789",
  "outputChannelId": "C0123456789",
  "enabled": true,
  "reuseSession": false,
  "createdAt": "2026-04-13T00:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-04-13T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Example recurring task item:

```json
{
  "pk": "WORKSPACE#T0123456789",
  "sk": "RECURRING_TASK#rt_cfc324a11246c10f",
  "recurringTaskId": "rt_cfc324a11246c10f",
  "workspaceId": "T0123456789",
  "title": "Submit weekly report",
  "recurrence": {
    "frequency": "weekly",
    "interval": 1,
    "daysOfWeek": ["friday"]
  },
  "dueTime": "17:00",
  "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo",
  "enabled": true,
  "ownerUserId": "U0123456789",
  "priority": "medium",
  "sourceType": "agent",
  "createdAt": "2026-05-11T00:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-05-11T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Attachments

Slack file support currently covers:

- PDFs
- images
- text-like files

Requirements and limits:

- your Slack app must include `files:read`
- the current default max file size is `10MB` per file
- supported Slack attachments are archived to a private S3 bucket before being sent to AgentCore Runtime
- unsupported or oversized files are recorded as skipped metadata and degraded into text notes instead of breaking the conversation

## AgentCore notes

- thread conversations are modeled as `Slack thread = AgentCore runtime session`
- custom tool execution runs inside `src/agentcore/runtime.ts`
- Lambda functions pass tool resource names to the runtime per request

## Security

- Do not commit real tokens, secret values, account IDs, runtime ARNs, or environment IDs.
- Do not commit `cdk.out/` artifacts or other generated deployment outputs.
- Keep Slack signing secrets, bot tokens, and Google OAuth client secrets in Secrets Manager only.
